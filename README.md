#Popular Movies, Stage 1 Implementation Guide#

Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family.
 In this project, I’ll build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing.
I’ll build the complete functionality of this app in two stages.

##Stage 1:  Main Discovery Screen, A Details View, and Settings##

#User Experience#

In this stage I’ll build the core experience of my movies app.

* Upon launch, present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters.
* Allow the user to change sort order via a setting.
  * The sort order can be by most popular, or by highest-rated.
* Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as
  * original title.
  * movie poster image thumbnail.
  * A plot synopsis.
  * user rating.
  * release date.
